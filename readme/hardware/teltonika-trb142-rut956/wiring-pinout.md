## Device to ALGE D-Line/GAZ

The device has a female port, the GAZ/D-Line banana plugs.&#x20;

| Pin Nr | Device | Display |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 5      | GND    | Black   |
| 2      | TxD    | Yellow  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
As the device does have a female port and not a male port as seen with PCs, you have to be carefully when using a cable with male connector and gender-switchers: On these cables you have to use the RxD side for transmitting as RxD and TxD will be swapped.&#x20;
