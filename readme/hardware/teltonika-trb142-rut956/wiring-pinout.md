| Pin Nr | Device | Display |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 5      | GND    | Black   |
| 2      | TxD    | Yellow  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
As the device does have a female port and not a male port as seen when connecting a RS232 adaptet to a PC, you have to be careful when using a cable with male connector and gender-switchers: On these cables you have to use the RxD side for transmitting as RxD and TxD will be swapped. Also the ground needs to be wired through.&#x20;

One can also find cross-over cables with male to male connectors, like this one [here](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B08LPT8RMF?ref=fed_asin_title).&#x20;
